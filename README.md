## Overview

This was my first ever frontend mentor challenge. I used this challenge to brush up my HTML and CSS knowledge. Although the design itself was seemingly easy but getting a pixel perfect design was tough. I used a bunch of basic CSS techniques. Explained [Here](#my-process)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

The very first thing I did was to first look at the design carefully and check for nuances if any. For example, in this case the design has a card within which there is a bunch of text and a QR Code image around it.

Although they may look like a unit (Which at the end they are) I decided to divide the component into 4 different components:

- Outer Card
- QR Image
- Bold bigger text
- Thin Smaller text.

Doing this helped in structutring the HTML appropriately ðŸ¤—. After that I decided on the basic styling on the components and then used flexbox majorly to position everything.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I was able to brush up on the basics of Flexbox and I was able to acheieve a mobile first and pixel perfect result fairly quickly.

```css
.qr-container {
  border-radius: 20px;
  display: flex;
  gap: 20px;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 450px;
  width: 300px;
  padding: 15px;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

### Continued development

Next time I will focus on using units other than px since they practically destroy the natural responsiveness of HTML.
